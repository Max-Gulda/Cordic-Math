## About The CORDIC Algorithm

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The cordic algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm to calculate trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, square roots, multiplications, divisions, exponentials, logarithms and more. The cordic algorithm dates back to 1956 but still work great for microcontrollers.

Cordic uses simple simple bit-shift operations for several computing tasks.
